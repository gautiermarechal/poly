      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I wanted to expand my Arduino and electronics knowledge. Spring season coming in south of France, I thought of linking technology and harvesting. So I decided to build an automatic greenhouse.
Goal The idea is to automatize everything a human has to manage with a greenhouse. My ultimate goal is not to create a product that could be commercialized. I only had intentions to learn as much as possible with this project, linking electronics and gardening.</description>
