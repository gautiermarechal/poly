[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I wanted to expand my Arduino and electronics knowledge. Spring season coming in south of France, I thought of linking technology and harvesting.

My ultimate goal is not to create a product that could be commercialized. I only had intentions to learn as much as possible with this project, linking electronics and gardening.\nMy biggest wish was to realize what could I accomplish with my basic knowedge of electronics and Arduino.\nList of components Electronics  Air temperature and humidity sensor (DHT22) x 1 Soil moisture sensors x 2 Arduino Uno x 1 4 relays module x 1 12V DC fan x 2 5V water pump x 1  Other Greenhouse Structure  80 cm wood pieces x 2 40 cm wood pieces x 2 Plexiglas x 4  Water Installation  Plastic tube 3m Water valves x 6 Water tank 1L  Inputs to control    Input Output     Temperature is too high Turn ON Fans   Temperature is too low Turn OFF Fans   Soil Moisture is too low Turn ON pump for 1min    Simple as that. The only human input is to fill the water tank when it\u0026rsquo;s empty.\nHow it works The arduino is monitoring air temperature and soil moisture via the sensors. It turns on and off fans and pump via the 4 relays module. The 4 relays module is connected to the fans and pump. Fans are 12V so require a different source of energy than the rest of the system that allows a maximum of 5V. I could have used resistors to use a higher voltage power supply and use only one source.\nWhat sould be improved A lot of things. This project is just for fun.\nI would:\n  Add and LCD screen to display informations such as temperature, soil moisture etc\u0026hellip;\n  Add a motor to open the ceiling of the greenhouse when too hot, for a better reduction of temperature than fans.\n  Improve the wirings of the system that is quite messy right now.\n  Add an ultrasonic sensor to the water tank to monitor water level.\n  Thoughts In the future, will we be able to have a sustainable technology that could symbioses with nature at a local scale? These kinds of projects prove that individual agriculture could potentially develop with these kinds of innovations. This project does not cost a lot of money and could be easily commercialized. I am pretty sure companies already exist. The goal of this project post is also to show that this kind of technology exist and may be useful for people to be slightly more self-sustainable. The problem is not the lack of technology but the lack of awareness about these technologies. Arduino and other board providers are bringing something interesting and people should know.\n","permalink":"https://gaut.io/projects/automatic-greenhouse/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I wanted to expand my Arduino and electronics knowledge.

However, some groups have not always agreed together, causing multiple conflicts that shaped our history. Cryptography has shown itself as a tool to make communication between two parties secret to any other partie. This tool has been way more important than we think, and we will explore how it shaped history in the past, in the present and in the future. In a world where huge entities and governments are more and more present in individuals’ daily lives, securing data with cryptography will be an essential tool to have in hand.\nCryptography has existed for thousands of years.\nThe first form of cryptography has been observed in ancient Egypt on tomb walls in 1900 BC. Unusual symbols were carved on the tomb of Knumotep II to confuse the reader and enhance mystery.\nMoreover, in 5 BC, spartans created a cryptographic device called a Scytale. The tool was a stick wrapped with a piece of leather carrying the message. It was readable only when wrapped on this particular diameter cylinder allowing letters to align. The recipient of the message needed the exact same diameter Scytale to decrypt the message.\nAnother great example is the Caesar cipher, named after the emperor who created this technique to secretly communicate in an era of treachery. The technique is known as substitution, consisting of each letter being replaced with another that only the recipient knows.\nThere are multiple other historic examples of cryptography used in the ancient world, that allowed interactions to remain secret between two parties.\nDuring history, cryptography was often used by the governing monarchs or emperors to communicate internally. The communications encryptions were often dedicated for military planning or any religious piece of writings. Julius Caesar used his famous cipher to organize strategies with his generals. The Greek Magical Papyri from 100 BCE contained rituals, hymns and spells written in a special language with ancient greek that was impossible to read for a normal reader. Creating encrypted messages was meant to keep communication secrets within groups, and form exclusivity for members of the group. The ciphers were only known by these members.\nHowever, in the 700s, Al-Khali, an arab philologist wrote the first documentation of a cryptographic techniques standard called Book of Cryptographic Messages. This was the first time a formal documentation of techniques existed. This gave a new approach vision to cryptography. The science continued to be nourished in the 800s, when Al-Kindi invented frequency analysis, the measure of letters frequency in the arab language. This was the first ever known cryptography breaking technique ever invented and marked the start of the field. However, we would not see any major advances until WW2.\nDuring WW2, Germans created and used the famous rotor machine called Enigma. The machine was basically made of a keyboard, a lampboard and a set of rotors in between. Typing a letter on the keyboard would lighten a different letter on the lampboard. This substitution was made possible via specific wiring controlled by the rotor, that would change the connections depending on the configuration that the user could change manually. This allowed the machine to operate a polyalphabetic substitution, meaning that each letter could be replaced by different letters. The alphabet was replaceable by multiple alphabets. All the functioning was electromechanical.\nThis machine was a major technological advancement at the time, and so was its breaking by the British with Ultra. Germans communicated military information via morse codes on radio that was written initially with Enigma. Communications were unbreakable and allowed Germans to take advantage of the field. When the British broke the machine, Allies took back the advantage to win and end the war. According to estimates, the war was shortened by two to four years with the breaking.\nAll the previous cryptographic techniques or machines were mainly using lexicography and hardware. With the arrival of computing, the same principle of hiding messages had been translated to software.\nModern cryptography makes use of mathematics to encrypt data into an unreadable data. The message sent is encrypted into a set of unreadable characters, via a complex mathematical algorithm.\nThere are two main types of cryptography techniques nowadays: symmetric-key and asymmetric-key (or public-key cryptography).\nSymmetric Key Symmetric key cryptography is when the sender and the receiver share the same key encrypt and decrypt the message. If Alice sends a message to Bob, the message will be encrypted with Alice’s key and Bob will use this same key to decrypt the message. Symmetric keys are implemented as three different methods: block ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions.\nTo make it simple, block ciphers are encryption of fixed-length f blocks of texts and stream ciphers are encrypting each single character by combining them to digits in the key stream.\nBoth are dictated by a deterministic algorithm.\nA deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given an input, will always produce the same output with that specific input.\nFinally, hash functions are one way functions that will encrypt a message input into a fixed array output of digits. Hash functions are not reversible and the only way to find the input is to brute force the function and match all the results with the fixed array we have. However, the number of possibilities is enormous. This is what makes hash functions a powerful tool.\nThe main problem with symmetric key cryptography is to exchange the key between the sender and the recipient. This allows for security breach as usually nowadays, cryptography is operated on the internet and the two parties cannot meet in secret to exchange the key. This is where asymmetric cryptography comes into play.\nAsymmetric Key In 1976, researchers highlighted the security issue of having one single key for encryption and decryption and proposed a system of a public key and private key pair. An encrypted communication would use a public-key to encrypt the message, and a private key to decrypt it. The public key can be distributed freely whereas the private key must remain secret. Both keys are mathematically related but this relation is complex and requires a difficult problem solving.\nThe main advance in this method is that the receiver who uses the public key to decrypt the message, in reality verifies that the message has been created by someone who possesses the corresponding private key.\nLet’s say, Alice and Bob both have key pairs. Alice knows Bob’s public key and the contrary is also true. If Alice encrypts a message with Bob’s public key and sends it to Bob, Bob will be able to use his private key to verify that the message has been sent and encrypted by Alice with Bob’s public key. Therefore, the communication is completely secure and both parties do not need to exchange anything privately. Everything is based on verification. If a third party, named John intercepts the message, he will know Bob’s public key but won’t be able to verify the message with its private key. Because a pair of keys are mathematically related, John’s private key does not correspond to Bob’s public key. He would need Bob’s private key to decrypt the message. This cryptography solution based on verification has been a groundbreaking advance in the field, but also in history in general.\nAs stated above, cryptography has always been used in history by large instances as military forces and governments. With the arrival of computing and the internet, the power is incrementally shifting from vertical to horizontal. Individuals nowadays have way more power than before compared with high instances as governments. The equality of opportunities has significantly increased with the internet, opening a large set of path alternatives for people.\nThanks to the internet people are more free, but still large entities control a large amount of internet users. Huge companies as Google, Facebook or Amazon possess private data of their users, breaking the decentralized model cryptography has to offer. However, this is subject to change. People’s trust toward these giants is shifting, as the awareness of the situation is increasing. Scandals as Cambridge Analytica highlight the excess of power these instances possess.\nThe internet has become a panopticon. A panopticon was a type of architecture used in prisons, designed by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. The concept was that a single guard was placed in the middle of a circular room, allowing all the prisoners to be possibly observed by the guard. It was physically impossible for the guard to monitor all the inmates. The main idea was that the inmates would feel constantly observed, not knowing where the guard would look at a certain point in time. They would constantly act as they were being watched. This is exactly the same feeling the internet is giving to people. A psychological war is constantly engaged in our private activities on the web.\nThe model of huge internet companies might start shifting. As an example, the app Signal to communicate privately marks the arrival of a new model: an open-source NGO, relied entirely on donations and verification of peer-reviewers. Reviewers who are people like you and me, verify that the Signal cryptographic protocols used to encrypt message communications are correct and trusty. This model starts to grab the attention of many users. In January 2021, 20 million users shifted from Whatsapp to Signal after Facebook announced it would be able to access Whatsapp data.\nThis model of power is also (mostly) present in Bitcoin. Created in 2009, Bitcoin fundamentals rely mostly on cryptography. Asymmetric key cryptography is used in Bitcoin, allowing users to privately transact, stopping any third party as a government or a company to interfere in the process. It is the first time in history that individuals have this power in their hands. All thanks to mathematics and cryptography.\nIf a communication tool and a currency become completely sovereign, distinct from a centralized instance, what is the limit? This model can be applicable to any other online tool with cryptography being the main pillar of this revolutionary system.\n","permalink":"https://gaut.io/posts/cryptography-implications/","summary":"Human success on the planet has been made possible thanks to our ability to communicate in the purpose of solving complex problems as groups.

Since 200,000 years, humans have accumulated an immense set of knowledge in many different fields. Doing so has been possible with abstraction, a concept that helps us grow our knowledge in a lot of different ways. We will explore what abstraction is with a philosophy perspective, to help us understand abstraction in computer science and the human brain.\nOne of the most popular reflections of abstraction in philosophy has been made by John Locke in 1689. In book III, Locke mentions that in the language, we use general terms to speak about particulars. The reason is that there are too many particulars to think about, and it would be an overwhelming task for the mind to remember all the specifics. Therefore, we use general terms as words that classify specific things under a group. This classification is made possible with abstraction.\nFor example, the word “horse” encompasses anything that resembles a horse in your perception. All these particular elements in the group are linked by the essence that makes each element part of the group. And this essence is the result of the abstract ideas that you have of horses. Abstraction forms the essence in the mind and creates knowledge as a whole.\nNow, what is clearly an abstraction? The roots of the word define something abstracted as “something pulled or drawn away”. This is exactly the process that the mind engages in when grouping ideas as mentioned above. It converts the real element to a mental appearance (or idea) and detaches the latter from any real-life features as space or time.\nSo there is the process:\n Mind identifies a real thing Converts it to idea Detaches from real life Observe the essence of the element Group the element under a general idea = an abstract idea.  Now let’s identify abstraction in Computer Science, a human created field, and see how this process of abstraction can be reflected in this field.\nA computer contains a CPU, the brain of the computer. The CPU receives electric current through its architecture. The wiring inside the CPU will interpret an electric current as a 1 and an absence of electric current as a 0. These sets of 1s and 0s are instructions sent from the RAM to the CPU, telling it to execute certain things. Then, when the CPU knows what to do, it will process instructions again as electric current to other components on the motherboard.\nTo execute such tasks, the CPU needs to perform computations under the form of calculations. These calculations are made possible with logic gates. Logic gates are electronic components called transistors, that we find on the electric board. A logic gate accepts electric current as input and will output a 0 or a 1. The output depends on the input, and there are different logic gates that will have different logic to output the result.\nLet’s take the AND gate. It outputs a 1 only if all the inputs are 1s, otherwise it outputs a 0. So if we give 1 and 0, the result will be 0.\nNow imagine an entire electronic board made of a large amount of these gates, and the possibilities of calculations.\nAll the things mentioned above are at the physical level, or the lowest level of abstraction possible. This means that we are the closest of reality, as electricity is a natural process of electrons flowing through material. Now let’s increase the level of abstraction from electric current to structured set of instructions.\nWhere do all these instructions originally come from?\nThe answer is programs. Computer programs are just a way for humans to send instructions to the CPU. Now we are a level of abstraction higher from the physical level.\nIn computer programs, there are several levels of abstraction depending on their “distance” from the physical components of the motherboard.\nThe lowest programming language is the machine language, that contains functions as bits, sent directly to the CPU.\nThen, if we increase the level of abstraction, or in other words, detach even more from the reality of electric current, we have assembly language.\nAssembly Language contains instructions that are human understandable, to communicate with the CPU. For example, the “MOV” instruction allows assembly languages to tell the CPU to move data into a specific place.\nNow let’s move up again to the higher abstraction level and see high-level languages.\nHigh-level languages are programming languages with which programmers can use natural language to write programs that will send instructions to the CPU. In Java, which is a high-level language, you will write System.out.print(“Hello World”); to display on the monitor “Hello World”.\nThe word “print” directly matches the idea of printing for the programmer, making the language convenient to use.\nThe language will be translated to assembly language via a compiler, and then the assembly language will give machine code, instructing the CPU.\nAnd above all, are visual languages or even the input from a user. The input will trigger high level language instructions that will trigger the cascade stated before.\nAll these different levels in the computer language are all linked thanks to abstraction. This process is similar to the abstract ideas that John Locke discussed in the 17th century. Similarly to specific ideas in the mind transformed to general ideas by abstraction, the specific that is the electric current is translated through multiple layers to the level of understanding for humans. The electric current that is real, is seen as a mental appearance, detached from reality, transformed into natural word languages. These natural word languages are programming languages that we use nowadays and that dictates a large part of our societies.\n","permalink":"https://gaut.io/posts/abstraction-mind-computers/","summary":"The concept of abstraction is fundamentally essential and rooted in human existence.

Thermodynamics is one of them. This is a broad and generic subject that gives opportunity to parallel it with a lot of aspects in the world. Today we will parallel it with psychology, and more particularly to the human mind.\nThermodynamics is the science of heat, work, temperature and their relations to energy. Let’s decompose these:\n Heat: the energy transferred between two systems as a result of their differences in temperature. Work: the energy transferred between two systems in the form of physical displacement. Temperature: the measure of energy released from vibration of molecules in a system. Energy: the measure that a system will need to transfer to perform work and heat  So as of now, we know that thermodynamics refer to isolated systems interacting between each other. We know that energy is used by any system under different forms. When riding a bike, the chemical energy in your muscles (ATP) is converted to mechanical energy in the bike pedals, which will move the bike and heat in your muscles.\nTherefore in this example, we clearly have a transfer of energy between two systems (person and bike), that results in heat and work (heat in the muscles, work in the movement of the bike). All this energy is not produced but converted. This is the first law of thermodynamics: energy cannot be produced or destroyed but can be converted to different forms. The amount of energy in the whole universe stays the same.\nAll this energy is manipulated by systems in the universe. Depending on its form, energy is more or less “useful” for a system. For example, energy as heat alone will not move the bike we are riding. This concept of energy quality is associated with the degree of disorder of the energy within the system. The measure of this disorder is called entropy.\nEntropy is the measure of unavailable energy in a system, which reflects the amount of disorder of that energy. The more entropy, the more disordered and less useful this energy is. This is what the second law of thermodynamics states: the entropy in the entire universe as an isolated system will increase overtime.\nHowever, we can observe that living beings on the planet are well structured, their entropy is low. This is because these systems are not isolated but open. They exchange energy with other systems in the universe to reduce their own entropy.\nStill, the universe is a closed system. And as the second law of thermodynamics states it, all isolated systems tend towards disorder or high entropy. So these open systems when exchanging energy will increase the entropy of the whole universe.\nNow, let’s dive into the theory of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on the order of the human mind. Mihaly says that “The normal state of the mind is chaos”. We order the mind with outside stimuli that grab our attention. Without these stimuli, the mind focuses on negative thoughts and pain. In other words, the human mind tends toward disorder, the same way an isolated system tends towards high entropy in thermodynamics. The human mind finds order by exchanging energy with external open systems, such as TV, Books or any other activity.\nThe paradox is that the human mind is an open system but behaves thermodynamically as an isolated system. This is what life forms are about: reducing their entropy by interacting with the outside world.\nThe reduction of entropy in the mind depends on the type of activity that stimulates it. The more mental energy that is used in the activity, the more structured the mind will be. Remember that there is a fixed amount of energy in the universe. The mental energy used in an activity will be allocated elsewhere in the universe. Social media and entertainment companies want your attention at its maximum simplicity. Hence, the mind will use low amounts of energy when being stimulated by these activities. Less energy will have less impact on the entropy in your mind, giving you an illusion of order. However, this degree of order is not as high as if you used greater quantities of energy in the activity.\nTo summarize, the mind is an open system that exchanges energy with outside systems to reduce its own entropy and therefore structure itself. The type of exchanges the mind does with these systems will vary the reduction of entropy.\n","permalink":"https://gaut.io/posts/thermo-and-human-mind/","summary":"When understood, some concepts can give the learner a completely new perspective of the world.
