When understood, some concepts can give the learner a completely new perspective of the world. Thermodynamics is one of them. This is a broad and generic subject that gives opportunity to parallel it with a lot of aspects in the world. Today we will parallel it with psychology, and more particularly to the human mind.

Thermodynamics is the science of heat, work, temperature and their relations to energy.
Letâ€™s decompose these:

- **Heat**: the energy transferred between two systems as a result of their differences in temperature.
- **Work**: the energy transferred between two systems in the form of physical displacement.
- **Temperature**: the measure of energy released from vibration of molecules in a system.
- **Energy**: the measure that a system will need to transfer to perform work and heat
